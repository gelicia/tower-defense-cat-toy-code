Note: The servos I got were MG90S, and they seemed to be a bit deeper than the ones the model was built for. I increased how wide apart the arms on the Canon_G.stl was, and the Plateau_N.stl was, then the height of the Socle_N.stl. Increasing the height of Socle_N.stl made it so the servo was too far away  from the top, but I ground down the pillars that youre supposed to screw into, then put enough E6000 in to hold it in place.

I started by doing this with IR, quickly got frustrated with it losing signals, and switched to a joystick, then switched to an accelerometer, then realized the most efficient way to do this was to just hold a laser pen in my hand. Hey, it's about the journey sometimes ;)
